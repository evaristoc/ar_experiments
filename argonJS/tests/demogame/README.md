## IDEAS

### Mission
* Show something about the park that is normally hidden; to make people to think about the park in a different way
* Augmented Excursion in the Park

### Info, Facilitation
* Guided
  * preliminary, to guide the task
  * about the findings given by the system
  * about the findings given by a facilitator
* Affected by the activities of other participants

### Playing area
* Based on a track vs Free search
* Restricted, divided by "habitats"
* Unrestricted (the whole park), divided by "habitats"
* Unrestricted

### Style of game
* individualist
* collaborative
* competitive (self, between individuals, or between groups) vs non-competitive

### Players cohesion
* Disperse
* Together

### Target group
* visitors, users
* schools (=> a facilitator is available)
* learning groups (=> a facilitator is available)
   * formal
   * informal

### Duration

### Risks

### Role of techonology
* Required for everyone
* Required for some participants (game played in small groups)
* To which point 3d/augmentation is really required?

### Value of the Scene
* Augmented suggests "it exists in the real"; the telephone as a window to see the things that are not usually visible, otherwise it is not required

### Some game permutations

#### Blind Guide
Using the phones by guide blinded users across some areas of the park by following sounds of animals that should live in certain sectors of the park 

#### A guided visit to sections of the park
In order to associated to natural elements and the concept of the park, the guide could be focused on birds and vegetation (habitats)
In might include games, likely simple humorous games, for fun and interactivity
Targeted to individual visitors
It could be combined eventually with the OudSarphati project, or give a different perspective 

#### Sound hunting without previous recognition
Nice as challenge; location not required; webcam not required, probably an virtual scene is better; can start from any location using current settings but could be configurated according to geolocation; can be individualist but also in group, even collaboratory

#### Sound collection + habitats
Better if collective, for further discussion of what has been collected; interesting if location-based (habitats); an extension of above?

#### Sound hunting with contrasting sounds: bird vs human
Either hunt the right one or leave it alive for the end (better)

#### Sound hunting with contrasting sounds: bird vs bird
This is more about recognition and differentiation; it can be between habitats or within habitat; with within habitat photos/models of the real animal can be included 

#### Sound recognition and hunting
Preliminary info about what to look for before starting hunting

#### Sound recognition with positioning (habitats)
It might be with or without sounds moving around - the rock game; would require location and webcam; in theory could start from any location but them user's fixed position (tech constrain); probably more individualist

#### Pokemon style
It requires location and webcam; harder to discuss and to add info; associated to a hunting game
