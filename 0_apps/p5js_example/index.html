							`
							Sappho, who wrongs you?
							For if she flees, soon she'll pursue,
							she doesn't accept gifts,
							but she'll give, if not now loving,
							soon she'll love even against her will
							
							@Sappho`,
							`
							I, my dearest Phyllis,
							who revere you as divine,
							who idolize your disdain,
							and venerate your rigor
							
							@Sister Juana InÃ©s de la Cruz
							`,
							`
							I have closed the double doors.
							In what corner of the heavens is she?
							A horizontal flute Beyond the red walls Blown
							as gently as the breeze Blows the willow floss.
							
							@Wu Tsao`,
							`
							Tell me,
							Was Venus more beautiful
							Than you are,
							When she topped
							The crinkled waves,
							Drifting shoreward
							On her plaited shell?
							
							@Amy Lowell`],
				w2m_quotes : [
							`
							I long for him most during these long moonless nights.
							I lie awake, hot,
							the growing fires
							of passion bursting in my heart.
							
							@Ono no Komachi`,
							`
							Cover mine eyes,
							O my Love!
							Mine eyes that are weary of bliss
							As of light that is poignant and strong
							O silence my lips with a kiss,
							My lips that are weary of song!
							
							@Sarojini Naidu`,
							`
							Remember me when I am gone away,
							Gone far away into the silent land;
							When you can no more hold me by the hand,
							Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay
							
							@Christina Rossetti`,
							`
							It's the fire in my eyes,
							And the flash of my teeth,
							The swing in my waist,
							And the joy in my feet.
							I'm a woman
							Phenomenally.
							Phenomenal woman,
							That's me.
							
							@Maya Angelou`],
				m2m_quotes : [
							`
							Oh secret voice of dark love!
							Oh bleeting without wool!
							Oh wound!
							Oh drooping camellia, needle of gall!
							Oh current without sea, city without wall!
							@Garcia Lorca`,
							`
							It shall be, I said, for eternity
							Twixt you and me!
							Dear friend, those times are over and done,
							Love's web is spun.
							
							@Oscar Wilde`,
							`
							Sweet Child,
							thou star of love and beauty bright,
							Alone thou lookest on the midnight skies;
							Oh! That my spirit were yon
							Heaven of light To gaze upon thee with a thousand eyes.
							
							@Plato`,
							`
							Thousand leagues, friend's heart cordial;
							one strand,
							fragrant silk purple resplendent.
							Breaking the seal,
							it glistens with a rose hue of the sun at eve â€“
							The pattern fills
							in the width of a breeze arising on autumnal waters.
							
							@Bo Juyi`],
				m2w_quotes : [
							`
							Deep, as drops from a statue's plinth
							The bee sucked in by the hyacinth,
							So will I bury me while burning,
							Quench like him at a plunge my yearning,
							Eyes in your eyes, lips on your lips!
							
							@Robert Browning`,
							`
							I like for you to be still
							And you seem far away
							It sounds as though you are lamenting
							A butterfly cooing like a dove
							And you hear me from far away
							And my voice does not reach you
							
							@Pablo Neruda`,
							`
							GIVE me women, wine, and snuff
							Untill I cry out 'hold, enough!'
							You may do so sans objection
							Till the day of resurrection:
							For, bless my beard, they aye shall be
							My beloved Trinity.
							
							@John Keats`,
							`
							The horizon behind is a wall of dark
							etched with a memory,
							fixed with a woman's face-they fight on and on,
							boots in the mud and heads in the gray
							rain-for the women they hate and the women they love-
							for the women they left behind, they fight on.
							
							@Carl Sandburg`]
