##*Experiencing Augmented Reality and Computer Vision with Javascript*

Here you will find my explorations around Augmented Reality and Computer Vision, all in Javascript. I also explore 2d, pseudo-3d and 3d graphics.

What I am doing is just making quick-and-dirty modifications from existing Javascript libraries and examples. Because the exploratory nature of the repo several scripts are verbosely commented and explained ([example](https://github.com/evaristoc/ar_experiments/blob/gh-pages/trackingPLUSjsfeat/nftPLUSaframe/test4.html)). Don't expect production-ready projects but mostly demos.

###Sources

Some of the libraries/frameworks used so far:
* [three.js](https://threejs.org/)
* [konva.js](https://konvajs.org/)
* [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js), also used for an example for [an article](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/an-intro-to-augmented-reality-for-the-javascript-developer-with-an-example-71875ab184ee)
* [argon.js](https://www.argonjs.io/)
* [jsfeat](https://inspirit.github.io/jsfeat/)
* [opencv.js](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d5/d10/tutorial_js_root.html)
* [tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)
* [aframe](https://aframe.io/) for AR
* [tracking.js](https://trackingjs.com/docs.html#trackers)
* [awe.js](https://github.com/buildar/awe.js/)

(*Be aware* that some of the libraries in use, although still working, might not be up-to-date.)

Models, animations and examples are usually found on codepen, Poly, three.js' pages, tutorials.

###Code Revisions
For those who like to have an insight of the code, I am posting pictures of some of my whiteboard analyses of some scripts, either originals or modifications. When modifying a script I usually look for better readibility, re-usability and separation of concerns. I usually write ES5 JS OOP / Module Pattern because I have found it still largerly widespread in computer graphics with JS, but there could be examples with other characteristics.
